\section{Description of Company}
Apple is one of the most successful companies of all time. Not only in the
U.S. but in the whole world. They are one of the biggest designers/manufacturers
of desktops, laptops/netbooks, tablets, and smartphones as
well~\cite{hoover}. Not to mention their massive grip on the multimedia realm
with iTunes, Apple Music, Apple TV, and their assortment of multimedia editing
programs. They don't only rule the school of multimedia and are rapidly seizing
the tech world due to it's easy-to-use interface and unix-based (DarwinOS)
background. Monetarily, the company does extremely well; as would any company
among the top in the world. Just one of their products, the iPhone, is
responsible for two-thirds of the company's revenue~\cite{hoover}. This may not
be too surprising because pretty much \emph{everyone} has an iPhone! That being
said, Apple's biggest claims to fame are as a computer hardware/software
manufacturing/designing company and as a catalyst of new technology in the
market.

Mostly everyone has heard of the founders Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak. Wozniak
left the company in 1983, only 3 years after the company went
public~\cite{hoover}. Jobs was with the company on and off\footnote{In 1985,
  Jobs resigned from Apple due to workplace drama with John Sculley. He rejoined
  Apple in 1997~\cite{jobs}.} until his death in 2011. After his death, Tim Cook
took over as CEO and remains CEO to this day. A few other notable employees of
the company are: Dr. Arthur Levinson, chairman, Jeff Williams, COO, Jonny Ive,
chief design officer, Craig Federighi, SVP software engineer, Dan Riccio, SVP
hardware engineer, and Phil Schiller, SVP worldwide marketer~\cite{hoover}. We
know most of these people from Apple's events which they come on stage to
talk. Jonny Ive is most known for the videos that reveal the newest Apple
projects. Either way, without these people, and many more, Apple would not be as
successful as it is today.

Most people know that Apple doesn't assemble most of their devices in the
US. How do they know this? Well, on the back of any Apple device, there will be
a note informing the user that it was designed in the US but assembled in
China. According to LexisNexis Academic, they have a subsidiary called
\emph{AuthenTec}. One of the locations for this company is in Shanghai, which I
believe is the main manufacturing plant for some of their bigger
products~\cite{lexis}. That being said, there are also some plants/facilities
found in Japan, Mexico, Europe, and even Australia~\cite{lexis}. Their
headquarters is located in Cupertino, Califonia and is approximately 16,000
sq. ft in size~\cite{hoover}. Apple has hundreds of locations all over the
world, ranging from design facilities to retail stores to manufacturing.

Needless to say, Apple does a lot of business. They sell a lot of product. In
fact, in 2016 they had about \$215,639,000 worth of sales~\cite{hoover}!
Also according to Hoover, they have a market value of about
\$594,339,610. Talk about big numbers! Apple sold approximately 226,200,000
iPhones~\cite{lifewire} and about 45,590,000 iPads~\cite{lifewire2} in 2016
alone. Just based on those approximate numbers, we can determine that Apple gets
all most all of it's revenue from the iPhone.\footnote{The iPhone, at full
  retail price, is about \$800. Multiply that by the number of sold iPhones, we
  get \$180,960,000. That's about 84\% of their sales!} Let's not forget the
other slew of products they sell that weren't mentioned. That being said, the
volume of product from Apple is absolutely enormous! Along with their huge fan
base, it's no wonder they are so successful.

\section{Discussion of Chart}
In the figures found on the previous page, you will notice that I chose to
compare Apple to the NASDAQ for the past 3 months, year, and 5 years. Firstly,
my reasoning for choose NASDAQ was simple; I felt as though it would give a
good visual as to how the market as a whole was doing. Secondly, I selected
multiple graphs so that I could analyze the company for longer than just the
required period; not to mention the \emph{Financial Performance} section has to
do with the past 5 years. Now that the preliminaries are out of the way, let the
discussion begin!

While looking at the graphs, one would notice that Apple seems to be doing quite
poor in comparison to the NASDAQ; except for the past 2 months (Feb. through
Apr.). For the past years, Apple has been dancing around the NASDAQ, as seen in
Figure 2. During spring-summer months, Apple tends to do poorly because they
don't have anything huge being released. iPhones tend to be released in
September and, as we saw earlier, is their biggest seller. This would explain
how in Figure 2, Apple jumps up to about even with the NASDAQ. The new iPhone
would then ride the company through Christmas and into the new year. This
doesn't explain why they are 20\% above the NASDAQ from February until
now. Well, it looks as though the company had it's best holiday quarter ever in
2016~\cite{fool}. Also according to The Motley Fools, ``their fast-growing
service segment ... has expanded to nearly 10\% of sales, and soaring demand for
apps pushed its high-margin revenue.'' This very well could explain that large
jump, although, I'm not sure if I believe it or not.

The last thing to discuss is the company's 5 year graph. In 2012, Apple was
about fair with the NASDAQ. Then the NASDAQ started to move away, and never
crossing paths again until this year. I found this rather interesting but I
believe that the reasoning for this is that Apple has a safety net. The company,
although very intuitive, doesn't make extreme changes on their
products.\footnote{Besides them removing the 3.5mm headset jack on their newest
  model iPhone.} This gives the customer as sense of home, even when they get a
new device. While they are doing that, the market is trying all sorts of new
things. Since the NASDAQ doesn't solely rely on Apple, it might have to do with
other companies making more galvanizing devices that caused the NASDAQ to leave
Apple in the dust.

\section{Financial Performance}
Most of the information I will be discussing in this section can be found in
Section 11.1 (Balance Sheet), which are sections from Apple's balance sheet. They
contain the past 5 years. Going right down the line, you will find the assets
table first. The very first thing to note is that 2016 seems to have the biggest
numbers in almost all the categories; some even being significantly larger. For
example, their total current assets is up from 2015 by about 17,491 million,
total assets are up 31,207 million, and cash/equivalents are up 25,554
million. There don't seem to be any major decreases, which is good. There are
any major drops, except the drop in other current assets by 6,502
million. Overall, this part of the balance sheet looks good and points the
company toward a successful direction.

Looking at the next piece of the balance sheet is the liabilities. The only
thing that I'm going to note is that the total liabilities seem to be increasing
with time. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it isn't necessarily a good
thing either. Luckily, their total assets is significantly greater than their
total liabilities. So far the company seems to be holding up well on their
balance sheet. Let's look into the income and cash flow statements.

The income statement is found in Section 11.2 (Income Statement). The very first
thing I noticed was that 2016 dropped by about 10,000 million in almost every
category. In fact, the sales dropped by about 15,000 million. Another
interesting thing to note is that 2015 has the highest numbers for all the years
listed. Luckily the cost of goods also dropped as well, saving the company some
money. The numbers dropped, but they didn't drop below any previous year, which
is good. Overall, it's bad that it dropped, but nothing too scary yet. The cash
flow statement, found in Section 11.3 (Cash Flow Statement), supports the same
claim, for the most part. It seems as though they increased the number of
operating activities\footnote{This could be because of their iPhone recycling
  campaign, if so, that's a warm fuzzy to consider.} and dropped
investments. In this case, some of the values dropped below previous years,
but, yet again, this isn't something to worry about too much. Overall, I believe
that the company is growing, despite having a couple small set backs. I believe
this because the company's numbers are still high and haven't dropped too
low. However, it's still very important that they keep it up or they could be in
trouble.

\newpage

\section{Performance Ratios}
All of the ratios I will be discussing in this section will be coming from
Zack's balance sheet and income statement found in section 11. My calculations
are found in Appendix A. First and foremost, you will notice that Apple's PE
ratio for all five previous years have been fairly close. They aren't extremely
small, but I suppose they could be higher. In the grand scheme of things, I
believe this is a fairly good stock; for all of the years. Their current ratio
is also good because it is greater than 1. They did get very close to 1 in 2015
and 2014 but looks like they're going up. Throughout the years listed, Apple
seems to have an alright quick ratio as well. It only dropped under a dollar for
2 years, 2015 and 2014, and seems to be going back up. Although these number are
best when higher, they aren't terrible, for the most part.

We've looked at the company's ability to pay off their debt, now let's look at
their actual debt. According to my calculations, about 60\% of the company is
debt to others currently. This is quite the percentage! As I expected, the
percent is going up with the years due to their ever increasing costs. In 2012,
the company was only about 33\% debt which means that it increased its debt by
about 30\% in 4 years. I don't really find this all that surprising coming from
Apple, but 60\% is a lot of debt. Looking back at their current ratio, the
company does have the ability to pay back their current debt. This may mean that
they also have the ability to pay back there long term debt. Whether this is
accurate or not, I'm not entirely sure. Let's look more into their ratios to see
if we can unwrap this mysterious case.

To my surprise, the working capital wasn't extremely large;\footnote{Don't get
  me wrong, it was \emph{large} just not to the extreme} especially in 2014 and
2015. Once again we see the same trough in those years and Apple come out of it
in 2016. In fact, the working capital more than tripled from 2015! As discussed
earlier, 2016 was when Apple started to meet up with the NASDAQ in the stock
market. This obviously means that 2016 was a very important time for the
company. While on the topic of dollar amounts, their new worth is fairly
consistent with the rest of the data. Once again, there was a drop in 2014 and
2015 and an increase into 2016. The drop is about 10,000 million, which is
significant. It's a good thing that they got out of that trough.

Looking at the return on assets for Apple, I noticed that early on was
better. 2013 and 2012 both had high number, meaning that their assets must
having been making very good profit. Contrary to the past situations, 2015 and
2014 didn't prove to be terrible for ROA, in fact, they were about average for
the company during these 5 years. In terms of return on equity, there isn't much
change. Oddly enough, their returns are pretty constant throughout the five
years. The maximum was in 2012 and the minimum in 2015. Not too much to say
here. Lastly, their return on sales for the most part are constant throughout
the 5 year range. The only except is for 2016, where the ROS dropped by about
15\%. This could mean that Apple didn't use their assets very wisely in
2016. Overall, their return numbers are excellent for the most part.

The last ratios I will be discussing are the profit margins. Their PM before
taxes throughout the 5 years were consistent. There weren't any huge drops or
increases. The same can be said about the PM after taxes. In fact, the
difference between the PBIT and PAIT isn't very big at all, maxing out around
9\% in 2012. On average the company seems to be making about 20-30\% profit
after taxes. This isn't great but I wouldn't say that it is bad
either. Overall, you can see that Apple's performance is great. There are only a
few areas in which I'm a little unsure about, namely, their debt. However, with
Apple's strong hold on the market, I don't think this will be a big issue.

\section{Positives \& Negatives}
From the last section, I found out a lot of information about Apple that could
be seen as positive or negative. Starting with the positives, the company seems
to have a decent current ratio. This means the company is able to pay off their
current debt. This, however, may not be important because they have a high long
term debt. Another positive factor from their performance is that they have a
decent net worth. They also have very stable profit margins. Out of all the
information given, I believe that the most important piece to the puzzle is that
the company is able to get themselves out of trouble. We saw how they dropped
in 2014 but they return stronger than every in 2016 and now. We could also see
this on the stock graphs from earlier. The company seemed to be behind the
NASDAQ yet came back with vengeance in 2016. I believe that this is the most
positive thing that Apple has going for them financially.

Along with a good set of positives are always a set of negatives. The negatives
that I saw from Apple were simple: debt. The company seems to have a large
debt. From my calculations, it's about 60\% of the company. This is a very large
amount of debt that would make me feel unconformable if I were running the
business. However, this information is from 2016 and we are well into 2017. The
company could have, at this point, paid some of that debt off. Since we saw that
they have a decent current ratio, this could be possible.\footnote{I'm aware
  that CR has to do with \emph{current} debt, not long term, but I would imagine
  that a company whom can pay off current debt, can probably pay off long term
  for the most part.} As mentioned before, I don't truly know if this debt would
be consider an actual issue for the company givens its position on the
market. I'm sure that their people are well aware of the deficit and are working
on ways to lower it, without costing the company valuable product quality.

In my opinion, banks will most likely be happy to give Apple loans. Since Apple
makes a ton of money and has a pretty good current ratio, I don't think that
banks would have any serious issue with loaning to the company. There is,
however, one reason that I can think of that would deter banks from giving loans
to: Apple's large debt. I could see why banks wouldn't want to.
